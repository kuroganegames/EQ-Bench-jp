It's not about instant results. \nGrayson: Or maybe it's about keeping the public distracted while you hide the real truth.\nDr. Sinclair: And what truth would that be, Mr. Hawk?\nGrayson: That there are aliens out there, and you people at NASA know it.\nDr. Sinclair: Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, Grayson.\nGrayson: Oh, I have evidence. I've got testimonials, photos, documents...\nDr. Sinclair: Anecdotes and blurry photos aren't evidence, Grayson. They're stories. \nGrayson: Stories that you're too afraid to believe.\nDr. Sinclair: No, stories that don't hold up under scientific scrutiny. \nGrayson: You're just a puppet, Sinclair. They've got you so convinced of your 'facts' that you can't see the truth.\nDr. Sinclair: And you're a sensationalist, Hawk. You've built a career on paranoia and misinformation.\nGrayson: At least I'm not lying to the public.\nDr. Sinclair: I'm not lying, Grayson. I'm presenting facts, not theories.\nGrayson: Your 'facts' are just what they want you to believe. \nDr. Sinclair: And your theories are what your followers want to hear. It's a comforting narrative, isn't it? The idea that there's some grand conspiracy, that you're the hero fighting against it.\nGrayson: And you're just a cog in the machine, Sinclair. You're part of the problem.\nDr. Sinclair: I'm part of the solution, Grayson. I'm trying to educate people, not feed them fantasies.\nGrayson: You're the fantasy, Sinclair.

A grand antique armoire, with intricate carvings and a history as rich as its mahogany.\nHenrietta: And why, pray tell, would I need an armoire, Mr. Harrington?\nBarty: Well, Mrs. Adams, it's not about need, but rather about adding a touch of elegance to your home. It's a statement piece, a testament to your refined taste.\nHenrietta: My home does not need any more statements, Mr. Harrington. It speaks volumes of my life as it is.\nBarty: But think of the value, Mrs. Adams! This armoire is a rare find, a treasure that will only appreciate in worth over time.\nHenrietta: I have no need for such investments, Mr. Harrington. My treasures are my memories, not pieces of wood.\nBarty: Ah, but this is not just any piece of wood, Mrs. Adams. It's a piece of history, a story waiting to be told.\nHenrietta: And who would I tell this story to, Mr. Harrington? The walls of my home? They have heard enough stories for a lifetime.\nBarty: Mrs. Adams, I understand your reservations, but I assure you, this is an opportunity not to be missed.\nHenrietta: And I assure you, Mr. Harrington, I am not missing anything.
